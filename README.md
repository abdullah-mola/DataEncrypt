# DataEncrypt
A concept app that uses Jetpack Security to encrypt user data such as text files or images using Encrypted Shared Preferences and uses Biometrics for authentication. The data can only be decrypted after the user is authorized via a master key or Biometric authentication.
The app also displays the list of encrypted files and decrypts them on successful authentication.
